# DeviceOrientationEvent - Demo
This is a demo of the deviceorientation event API as defined by [W3C](http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html#deviceorientation).

## What does the demo do?
The demo uses the deviceorientation event API to collect orientation data on the iPhone. The data is sent to a mirror-server using websockets. The data is then used to move an <code>#image</code> or a <code>#cursor</code> in the browser (you will need to manually edit the code to switch between an image or a cursor). The image used is [melbjs](http://melbjs.com/)'s logo.

+ The demo is built to run with Chrome on Mac OSX Mountain Lion and an iPhone 4. I haven't extensively tested it on other browsers or devices, but it should still workâ€¦ let me know how you go [@hadi_michael](http://www.twitter.com/hadi_michael).
+ Both devices need to share the same wireless network.
+ Port :3000 should not be blocked by your router or firewall - if it is, modify server.js to listen on a different (available) port.

## Setup
You will need [node.js](http://www.nodejs.org), [express](http://expressjs.com/) and [socket.io](http://socket.io/) for this demo.

1. Download and install node.js from: [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
2. Once you have node, use the "node package manager" in terminal to install "express" using <code>$ npm install express</code> and "socket.io" using <code>$ npm install socket.io</code>.

### Read about the packages used:
+ express: [https://npmjs.org/package/express](https://npmjs.org/package/express)
+ socket.io: [https://npmjs.org/package/socket.io](https://npmjs.org/package/socket.io)

+ This demo also uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/).

## Running the demo
1. In terminal, start the server: <code>$ node /path/to/server.js</code>
2. In Chrome, navigate to: <code>http://localhost:3000</code> - if you have replaced the port number in server.js, then replace it here as well.
3. Connect to the server in Safari on your iPhone by navigating to <code>my.macs.ip.address:3000</code>. If you're on a small local home network, it is likely that your IP address will be something like <code>192.168.0.1</code>. If you don't know it, use <code>$ ifconfig</code> to get it.
